## [0.1.00] - 2024-08-03
 - Forked from https://github.com/cpyarger/Home-Assistant-Addons
 - Original project was multiple HACS addons in which the SDRMR addon used a
 driver which is incompatible with the RTL-Blog v4 R828T chipset. 
 This fork removes the other unnecessary addons and implements a HA plugin
 dedicated to the REST implementation of rtlamr.
